// Logs Every Incoming Request:
// Each time the server receives an HTTP request, this middleware function is executed.
// It logs the URL (req.url) of the request to the console, allowing you to monitor all requests being made to your server (e.g., /index.html, /d3/dist/d3.min.js).
// The next() function tells Express to move on to the next middleware or route handler in the request-processing pipeline.
// Without next(), the request would "hang," and no further processing (e.g., serving files, handling routes) would occur.
// Youâ€™d typically use middleware like this during development for debugging purposes. 
// In production, you'd likely use a more sophisticated logging tool like Morgan, which can log request details in a structured format.
